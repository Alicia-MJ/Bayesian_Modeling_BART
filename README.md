# Bayesian Modeling in the BART Task

 ## Problem
 Model risk behavior of two persons in the BART task using Bayesian modeling.
 
 ### Questions:
 • Different people have different risk levels of behavior?
 
 • Ahierarchical model will be better to explain the data that account for different persons or a simpler
 model will be enough?
 
 • If people are in the same contextual conditions, their behavior consistency is similar?


 ## Complete Report
 The report includes a brief explanation about the experimental task, the models used, results, analysis, conclussions and references. 
 
 See [report](Report.pdf) for more information.

  ## Datasets
 See [datasets](./Datasets) for more information.

 ## Bayesian Models
Each of the three models has a separate script in TXT format. One script is used for each different R code file.

- Model A = modelo_simple.txt
- Model B = modelo_g.txt
- Model C = modelo_gb.txt
 
 See the [bayesian models](./Bayesian_Models) for more information.

 ## R code
For each model (A, B and C) is a R code file and an script in txt format.

See the [R files](./R_code) for more information.
